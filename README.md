## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection for Firebase services
- No backend server required (Firebase Realtime Database)

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd College-Connect
   ```

2. **No additional dependencies required** - The project uses CDN links for:
   - Font Awesome icons
   - EmailJS for email functionality
   - Firebase SDK for backend services
   - Google Fonts

3. **Open the application**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or use a local server:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     # Then visit http://localhost:8000
     ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Firebase Setup

The application uses one shared Firebase app from [js/firebase-config.js](js/firebase-config.js). The web configuration is public Firebase application configuration; access control is provided by Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database rules.

```javascript
- Project ID: college-connect-2cd42
- Database: asia-southeast1
- Storage: Enabled for file uploads
- Messaging: Push notifications configured
```

### Required Firebase Setup

1. Enable **Authentication > Sign-in method > Email/Password** in the Firebase console.
2. Deploy [database.rules.json](database.rules.json) using Firebase CLI or the Firebase console.
3. Create the first administrator in Firebase Authentication, then add its UID under `admins/<uid>` with value `true`. Also create the matching administrator profile under `profiles/<uid>` with `role: "admin"`, plus matching `users` and `loginDirectory` records. Use the normalized database key in `id` and the display roll number in `rollNumber`.
4. Add the GitHub Pages domain to Firebase Authentication authorized domains.

Password recovery uses Firebase Authentication email reset. The application does not generate client-side OTPs or store passwords in Realtime Database.
